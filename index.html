          <p>Retail properties are organized into several different categories, which vary significantly depending on the location, size, and other factors:<br><br>

            Strip Malls and Shopping Centers: Clusters of stores that are grouped together, often in one or several unified buildings, to provide a centralized shopping experience. Some may have anchor tenants, or more noteworthy businesses that drive customers in and lead them to other stores.<br>
            Community Retail Center: Complexes that generally have more than one anchor tenant and several smaller businesses, normally spanning 150,000-300,000 square feet. <br>
            Power Center: A shopping center typically located near an interstate highway with at least one anchor tenant. Power centers typically have outparcels.<br>
            Regional Mall: A larger complex offering a variety of retail and restaurant options with several anchor tenants, such as big box retailers. Malls normally span 400,000 to 2,000,000 square feet, including higher-end shops, restaurants, and entertainment options.<br>
            Outparcel: Parcels of land within other larger plots leased to other tenants, such as shops, restaurants, fast food, chains, and more. Outparcels tend to rely on larger buildings for foot traffic.</p>

            Land is one of the riskiest types of commercial real estate to invest in, but can also offer the highest return. By definition, undeveloped land leaves the onus of generating revenue entirely on the investor. There are a few types of properties that fall within this category, and each presents unique challenges and opportunity when it comes to portfolio growth: <br><br>

            Agricultural Land: Also called greenfield land, this category includes farms, ranches, and other land without buildings <br>
            Infill Land: Urban plots that are currently vacant, but were once developed<br>
            Brownfield Land: Plots of land that previously held commercial buildings, usually with environmental stipulations<br></p>

          <p>Office buildings are generally divided into three classes, based on the buildings age, condition, location, and more:<br><br>

            Class A Office Buildings: The highest quality office buildings available, with higher-than-average rents compared to neighboring buildings. Most are newly renovated, easily accessible in city areas, and offer tenants desirable amenities. Class A buildings are usually located in the central business district of the city.<br>
            Class B Office Buildings: Competitive buildings that are generally priced around standard market rates. While they tend not to be in highly sought-after locations, Class B buildings may be equal or similar in quality to Class A buildings.<br>
            Class C Office Buildings: Less-than-ideal quality buildings that tend to be priced below average market rates. Class C office buildings may provide tenants with usable space, but without the added perks of an accessible location or amenities.<br></p>
